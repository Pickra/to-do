# To-do

This is my first attempt at a to-do app. I'm also using [Parse](https://www.parse.com/) for the 1st time as well as an assignment while at the [Iron Yard](http://theironyard.com/).


~~It's a little buggy, but it's on my to-do listâ€¦.~~

#### Refactor notes below

1. pressing the `make a new note` button removes the .hidden from .form
	- so now the 2 .form-groups in .main are visible

2. pressing the `save` button in .main is putting the value from `#title` into a property key called `title`, inside the Model/Parse Object `newNote`
	- it's like making an {} 
	- var whatever = {}

3. 











HIDE THE SAVE BUTTON UNTIL IT'S NEEDED

- make a new note
- save an edit
